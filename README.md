analysis of green power companies

## Purpose

    Help Steve's parents determine if "DAQO
    New Energy Corp", meets the minimum profitability requirements
    to make an investment and if there are other companies that can
    have an attractiveness similar to or even greater than that chosen by
    Steve's parents, this will be determined by the return
    of companies. 

## Results

### Comparing "DQ" on 2017 vs 2018

    If you look at the analysis of 2017 this company has a great
    return for that year (image A-1), it is the one with the best return of all
    the analyzed ones but if we see it a year later it has a behavior
    negative in fact is the one that falls the strongest of all which indicates
    which was possibly due to overbought (image A-2).

### Comparing the others companies

    If we look at the summary table of all the companies we will realize
    that there are only two that maintained their return in positive numbers such as
    "ENPH" and "RUN". ENPH has a return in 2017 of 129.5% and in 2018 81.9%
    which could make it more attractive, for its part "RUN" in 2017 has
    a 5.5% return and 84% in 2018, makes it a viable option but not as
    attractive as above company(images B1, B2).

### Anothers observation

    Try to determine if there is any obvious pattern for making a decision
    on which was the best option to invest, if for example we take into account
    the daily volume factor, we find that those who had higher
    volume also suffered losses in return and those that had lower
    volume also fell, the two companies that managed to escape the decline in
    return have similar daily volumes in 2017, however "SEDG" has
    a similar volume, however, presented a setback, minimal but still suffered,
    which seems not to be the best of the indicators to evaluate a company of
    investment, therefore the best thing in this case is to obtain
    more data to help us make a more informed and clear decision,
    more number of companies to analyze if we can find a pattern in any
    another (image C-1, C-2).

## Summary

    - What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


#### Advantages

    1. It allows us to optimize code that consumes excess resources.
    2. We can make the code clearer with comments and names of more explanatory variables
    3. Add functionality

#### Disadvantages

    1. You must have knowledge of the general operation of the code
    2. You could break the code generating wrong outputs or it could simply stop working

    - How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

    That of optimizing execution times since it now runs approximately 3 times faster, also 
    of adding functionality because we generate additional arrays to use them more optimally.

    In what could be cons is that of the general knowledge of the code, I had
    to do the whole module to know what the code was going to be able to refactor it
    with trust.
